The Objective: To build a predictive model that can find out the sales of each product at a particular store and then provide actionable recommendations to the BigMart sales team to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.

We have two datasets - Training data (8,523 observations) and testing data (5,681 observations). The training dataset has both input and output variables. In this project, I build a model to predict the sales quantities for the test dataset.
